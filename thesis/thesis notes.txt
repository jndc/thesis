Feature selection, 3 techniques:
		- univariate selection
		- feature importance
		- correlation matrix w/ heatmap

Filter method
	1) set of all features
	2) Select the best Subset 3 techniques (some important features):
		- chi square
		- anova test
		- correlation coefficient
	3) ML Algorithm
	4) Peformance
	
Wrapper Method
	1) forward selection
	2) backward elimination
		- chi square to calculate value of feature
			- p <= 0.05 is not valuable
	3) recursive feature elimination
	
Embedded method
